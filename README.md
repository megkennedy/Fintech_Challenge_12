# Fintech_Challenge_12

UW Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 12

For this challenge we are using machine learning to evaluate different data sampling techniques when using logistic regression to model credit risk problems.

## Libraries and dependencies needed

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from imblearn.metrics import classification_report_imbalanced

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

## Issues

The notebook seemed to forget some of the metrics imports, so I imported them again closer to when the code was using it.

## Contributors

As always a shout out to my professer, TAs, and classmates for all their help during this process
